# Test Data
Sample test data is provided in `test/data.json`. This file includes the examples laid out in the project's README. If you'd like to include additional torrents to test from your own selection, you can add those to `test/additional-data.json`. When running the tests, validation will be run on the data files to ensure they can have the tests run against them.
